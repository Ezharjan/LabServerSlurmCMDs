# Slurm Basic Command Toolkit for the Server of CV Lab

1. If you are using the server of CV Lab, only thing you have to do is just to revise the commands to yours inside `base_cmd.sh` .
2. If you are not using the server of CV Lab, you have to change the configurations of the different shel scripts so as to fit them to your server.
3. Change the project name in each of the configuration file so that you can view the running status easier on a public server,
4. Go to the `logs/` folder to see the log files after each running is finished.
5. This is a very simple tool that you only need to run `sbatch runG<X>.sh` to run a script on a Slurm server using GPU.
